# Portfolio

### [My personal site](https://aitorgallardo.github.io/portfolio/) built with Astro.

#### Deployed using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages).

##### Had to rename /\_astro for /styles and its ref to the file in /dist > index.html "_astro" for "./styles" in order to correctly deploy the site on Github Pages.
